# bar-widgets

A collection of BAR widgets I made for anyone to use.

- [idle_notfiier.lua](https://github.com/Nehroz/bar-widgets/blob/main/idle_notifier.lua) Audio queue and ping on idle cons appearing. alt+a move camera to latest idle and selects it until it's no longer idling; This will keep selecting idles in the same order as they appeared.
- [nearest_con.lua](https://github.com/Nehroz/bar-widgets/blob/main/nearest_con.lua)
  Selects the constructor nearest to the cursor. Provides the following actions:
  - `select_nearest_t1_constructor`
  - `select_nearest_t2_constructor`
  - `select_all_constructors`
